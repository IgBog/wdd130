    <h2>Ignacio Bogado</h2>
    <p>Hello everyone, my name is Ignacio. I am pursuing a degree as a software developer. My hobbies are reading and watching TV. I am from Venezuela, and currently, I live in South Jordan, Utah. I am 39 years old and married to a wonderful woman. We have two beautiful daughters. I have been a member of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints since 2004 and served a full-time mission for the Church. I love to serve and learn new things. I actually work as a construction worker in a bore crew. The thing I love most about BYU is the opportunity given to me to get a bachelor's degree online. I already have some education and an associate degree from my country in IT, so I want to be able to upgrade my knowledge and capacity to produce more money. My favorite scripture is 1 Nephi 3:7.</p>
